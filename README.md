# apollo-firestore

This project is setup to test interactions between GraphQL and Firestore.

I watched [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9XnnjFGMs) ans wanted to try GraphQL on my own. Some of the code was written by [@arjunyel](https://github.com/arjunyel) at [this repo](https://github.com/arjunyel/firestore-apollo-graphql).
